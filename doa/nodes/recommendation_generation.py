2. Extract the core thesis argument from the primary thesis (or synthesize from context if missing)
3. Include key catalysts from the thesis (specific events or developments that would drive the outcome)

- Avoid generic statements like "No specific catalysts identified" or "No strong signals"
- If the thesis is weak, synthesize from the market context and probability edge
